Desert Song

by Hilsong Worship
2009

This is my prayer in the desert
When all that's within me feels dry
This is my prayer in my hunger and need
My God is the God who provides

And this is my prayer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved
Of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flames

And I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain
I will rejoice, I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in the battle
When triumph is still on it's way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise I'll stand

And I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain
I will rejoice, I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

And I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain
I will rejoice, I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

This is my prayer in the harvest
When favour and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
The seed I've received I will sow

Forever

by Kari Jobe
2014

The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Saviour of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon Him

One final breath He gave
As heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting?
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever He is glorified
Forever He is lifted high
Forever He is risen
He is alive, He is alive

The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting?
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated

Forever He is glorified
Forever He is lifted high
Forever He is risen
He is alive, He is alive

We sing Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
The Lamb has overcome

Give thanks to the Lord our God and King

Goodness of God

by Bethel Music
2019

I love You Lord 
Oh Your mercy never fails me 
All my days I've been held in Your hands 
From the moment that I wake up 
Until I lay my head 
I will sing of the goodness of God 

All my life You have been faithful 
All my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able 
I will sing of the goodness of God 

I love Your voice 
You have led me through the fire 
In darkest nights 
You are close like no other 
I've known You as a father
 I've known You as a friend 
I have lived in the goodness of God

All my life You have been faithful 
All my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able 
I will sing of the goodness of God

Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me 
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me 
With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now, I give You everything 
Your goodness is running after, it’s running after me

Here I am to Worship

by Tim Hughes
2003

Light of the world,
You stepped down into darkness,
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You,
Hope of a life spent with You.
                
So here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
                
King of all days, oh, so highly exalted,
Glorious in heaven above,
Humbly You came
To the earth You created,
All for love's sake became poor.
                
So here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
                
Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
                
And I'll never know
How much  it cost
To see my sin
Upon that cross.
(repeat 2 more times)
                
So here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
                
Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
                
Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
                
Here I am to worship;
Here I am to bow down;
Here I am to say that
You're my God.
And You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.

Hosanna

by Hilsong United
2007

I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me

Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity

Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

House Of The Lord

by Phil Wickham
2021

We worship the God who was
We worship the God who is
We worship the God who evermore will be
He opened the prison doors
He parted the raging sea
Our God He holds the victory

There’s joy In the house of the Lord
There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won’t be quiet
We shout out Your praise
There’s Joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place
And we won’t be quiet
We shout out Your praise

We sing to the God who heals
We sing to the God who saves
We sing to the God who always makes a way
He hung upon that cross
Then He rose up from that grave
My God’s still rolling stones away

There’s joy In the house of the Lord
There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won’t be quiet
We shout out Your praise
There’s Joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place
And we won’t be quiet
We shout out Your praise

We were the beggars
Now we’re royalty
We were the prisoners
Now we’re running free
We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the Lord sing praise

There’s joy In the house of the Lord
There’s joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won’t be quiet
We shout out Your praise
There’s Joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place
And we won’t be quiet
We shout out Your praise

How great is our God

by Chris Tomlin
2014

The splendour of the king
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice, and trembles at His voice

How great is our God! Sing with me
How great is our God! And all will see
How great, how great is our God!

And age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the End, Beginning and the End
The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb

How great is our God! Sing with me
How great is our God! And all will see
How great, how great is our God!

Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God!

How great is our God! Sing with me
How great is our God! And all will see
How great, how great is our God!

I see the Glory (Tua Gloria)

by Fernanda Brum
1995

I see the glory of the Lord today here
His hand and power hanging over me
Open skies today I will contemplate
His love falling into this place

And now I want to see his power 
His glory filling out my heart
I will lift my hands and I will receive
I will keep on praising his name
Because I feel the Lord is touching me

Jesus is Alive (Hallelujah)

by Ron Kenoly
1991

Hallelujah, Jesus is alive
Death has lost its victory
And the grave has been denied
And Jesus lives forever
He's alive, He's alive

He's the alpha and omega
The first and last is He
The curse of sin is broken
And we have perfect liberty
The lamb of God has risen
He's alive, He's alive
Hallelujah Jesus is alive

Lion and the Lamb

by Leeland
2015

He's coming on the clouds
Kings and kingdoms will bow down
And every chain will break
As broken hearts declare His praise
For who can stop the Lord Almighty

And our God is the lion
The Lion of Judah
He's roaring with power
And fighting our battles
And every knee will bow before Him

Our God is the lamb
The lamb that was slain
For the sins of the world
His blood breaks the chains
And every knee will bow before the 
lion and the lamb (2x)

So, open up the gates
Make way before the King of Kings
The God who comes to save
Is here to set the captives free
For who can stop the Lord Almighty

And our God is the lion
The Lion of Judah
He's roaring with power
And fighting our battles
And every knee will bow before Him

Our God is the lamb
The lamb that was slain
For the sins of the world
His blood breaks the chains
And every knee will bow before the 
lion and the lamb (2x)

For who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty

For who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty

Our God is the lamb
The lamb that was slain
For the sins of the world
His blood breaks the chains
And every knee will bow before the 
lion and the lamb (2x)

Lord You are always here with me

by Livets Ord Worship

Lord You are always here with me 
There is no changing God in Thee 
You are the same yesterday
And today and forevermore

Here on Your promises I stand 
You hold my future in Your hand 
My solid Rock, Almighty God 
I worship You

When  trouble comes I trust in You 
For I know You will lead me through 
And I know You are faithful till the end

And when the storms are drawing near 
When I'm with You I don't have to fear 
You're my Shepherd on whom I can depend 
Through the day, through the night 
I know You're always by my side

Lord You are always here with me 
There is no changing God in Thee 
You are the same yesterday
And today and forevermore

Here on Your promises I stand 
You hold my future in Your hand

Lost in wonder

by Martyn Layzell
2009

You chose the cross with every breath
The perfect life, The perfect death
You chose the cross
A crown of thorns you wore for us
And crowned us with eternal life
You chose the cross
And though your soul was overwhelmed with pain
Obedient to death You overcame

I'm Lost in wonder
I'm lost in love
I'm lost in praise forevermore
Because of Jesus' unfailing love
I am forgiven
I am restored

You loosed the chords of sinfulness
And broke the chains of my disgrace
You chose the cross
Up from the grave victorious
You rose again so glorious
You chose the cross

The sorrow that surrounded you was mine
"Yet not my will but yours be done" You cried

I'm Lost in wonder
I'm lost in love
I'm lost in praise forevermore
Because of Jesus' unfailing love
I am forgiven
I am restored
Because of Jesus.
I am restore

Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)

by Hilsong United
2013

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep my faith will stand

I will call upon Your Name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You’ve never failed and You won’t start now

I will call upon Your Name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Saviour

I will call upon Your Name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Over The Mountains And The Sea

by Martin Smith
2006

Over the mountains and the sea,
Your river runs with love for me,
and I will open up my heart
and let the Healer set me free.
I'm happy to be in the truth,
and I will daily lift my hands:
for I will always sing of when
Your love came down. 

I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever.

Oh, I feel like dancing 
it's foolishness I know;
but, when the world has seen the light,
they will dance with joy,
like we're dancing now

I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever.
